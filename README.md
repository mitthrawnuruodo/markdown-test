Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.

Some basic Git commands are:

```
git status
git add
git commit
```

Put this in HTML:
```html
<p>This is a HTML tag</p>
```

Then add CSS to add color:
```css
.p { color: green; }
```

And log out to Console using JavaScript:
```js
console.log("Whatever you want");
```
